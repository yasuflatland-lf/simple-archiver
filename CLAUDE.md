# CLAUDE.md — simple-archiver

Mac/Windows native desktop app (Tauri 2) that takes drag-and-dropped rar/zip files/folders and batch-renames them into zip archives.
State: drag-and-drop `.rar`/`.zip` files/folders, batch-rename via a naming rule, compress with bounded parallelism, stream progress + ETA, cancel, and report a run summary. UI is a five-region `AppShell` (header / setup toolbar / optional alert banner / scrollable queue / status footer) from design-system tokens, with `lucide-react` icons and an `aria-disabled`/`aria-describedby` Run control. Latest landed: `.zip` input support (`classify` accepts `.zip`; a CRC-checked `ZipExtractor` with a zip-slip guard sits behind an `ArchiveExtractor` router; output is always re-normalized to Deflate zip), then the OUTPUT zone was restructured (full landing path promoted to a hero, aligned Destination/Name rows, a `(not set)`+`Required` empty state), the readiness chip moved from `OutputSettings` to `RunControls` (left of Run, idle-only), and a smart default output directory landed (`src/lib/output-dir-default.ts`: persist the last choice in `localStorage`, fall back to the OS Downloads dir via Tauri `downloadDir()`, applied on mount).

## Mandatory rules (harness)

- **Write all code comments in English.** Name identifiers in English too. Details: `.claude/conventions.md`.
- **TDD**: write tests before implementation (cargo-nextest / Vitest).
- **Layer boundaries**: `domain` is pure (no IO/async); IO lives behind the Extractor/Archiver/Clock ports; deps flow presentation→application→domain and infrastructure→domain.
- **Do not swap libraries** (Tauri 2 / async_zip / unrar / mockall / loom / oxlint / oxfmt are fixed choices).
- **One PR ≤ 1000 lines**, walking skeleton first; clippy/fmt/nextest/oxlint/oxfmt/vitest green before merge.
- Never `git commit` / `git push` until the user explicitly asks.

## Documentation layers (L1/L2/L3)

- **L1 = this file**: mandatory rules + doc map only (keep under 35 lines).
- **L2 = `docs/`**: how the project works.
  - `docs/architecture.md` — layered/hexagonal design and layer boundaries
  - `docs/development.md` — tech stack, dev commands, testing policy, PR rules
- **L3 = `.claude/`**: deep reference, consulted per task.
  - `.claude/conventions.md` — coding conventions (English-comment rule, naming, boundaries)
  - `.claude/domain-model.md` — domain model and invariants

## Source of truth

The authoritative design lives in Notion; the local mirror is `docs/superpowers/specs/` (git-ignored).
If these docs conflict with the design, treat the design as canonical and propose an update.
