## Overview

`simple-archiver` is a **Mac/Windows native desktop app** that lets you drag and drop multiple rar/zip files and folders and compresses them into zip archives following a batch rename rule.

- rar and zip files are first extracted, then re-compressed to zip; folders are zipped as-is
- processed by N parallel workers; sequence numbers are fixed at job-creation time in list order (independent of completion order)
- output goes to a single user-specified folder; name collisions are **not overwritten** — that task fails instead
- errors are **caught per task and other tasks continue**; a success/failure summary is shown
- cancellation is required for the MVP (interrupt in-flight work + clean up partial output/temp)

## Current state

**Rar extraction landed (PR8).** The execution engine is connected end-to-end: Tauri commands mutate a backend-held session draft, drive the application engine, and stream progress events to the frontend. Domain / application / infrastructure and the presentation adapter are all implemented. Rar support (extract → temp → zip) is complete: `UnrarExtractor` extracts into a `TempWorkspace` RAII guard; `FormatRegistry` routes `RarFile` → temp extraction → compression and `Folder` → direct compression. Treat this document as the live architecture description.

**Frontend**: the design-system foundation is in place (ASICS tokens, light/dark theme, Inter typography, Button/Input/Label primitives, ThemeProvider). **The main screen is wired end-to-end (PR7)**: drag-drop / dialog file intake, draft list with reorder, naming-rule preview, output-dir picker, run/cancel controls, per-file progress, and the failed-task summary — all driven through a zustand store that mirrors the backend draft.

## Layered / hexagonal structure

The Rust backend is split across a **Cargo workspace** with two crates: a pure `simple-archiver-core` crate holding `domain` / `application` / `infrastructure`, and the `src-tauri` crate holding `presentation`.

```
presentation   src-tauri/src/presentation/ — Tauri commands, session state, DTO/event wiring
               commands.rs  — eight Tauri commands (preview_output_name, add_items, reorder, set_naming_rule, clear_items, set_output_dir, run_job, cancel_job) + run_job_inner testability seam
               state.rs     — JobDraft (mutable session draft) + RunState (single-active-job guard) + AppState (Tauri managed state)
               dto.rs       — wire-contract DTOs with serde + ts-rs bindings (ProgressEvent, DraftSnapshot, JobSummaryDto, …)
               events.rs    — ProgressEmitter trait seam + TauriEmitter (production) + RecordingEmitter (test double)
application    simple-archiver-core — use case / orchestration
               RunArchiveJob: N parallel workers, progress aggregation, cancellation, error tally / ports: Extractor, Archiver, Clock / FormatRegistry: routes SourceItem to compressible dir
domain         simple-archiver-core — pure, no IO (the main TDD battleground)
               ArchiveJob (aggregate root) / ArchiveTask / NamingRule / SequenceNumber / SourceItem / OutputDirectory
infrastructure simple-archiver-core — isolates the variation / adapters
               ZipArchiver(async_zip) / UnrarExtractor(unrar) / TempWorkspace / SystemClock
```

**Why a workspace (core split from Tauri):** Tauri's `generate_context!()` requires the built frontend `dist/` at compile time. Keeping `domain`/`application` inside the Tauri crate would couple pure-logic `cargo test` / `clippy` to a frontend build. The standalone `simple-archiver-core` crate lets domain tests run with no `dist/`/webview (the TDD battleground stays fast); CI's `core` job builds `-p simple-archiver-core` so it never pulls in Tauri.

## Layer boundary discipline (strict)

- **Dependency direction**: `presentation → application → domain`, `infrastructure → domain`. `domain` depends on no other layer.
- **`domain` is pure**: no IO, async, or external-crate dependencies. All file/process/clock access goes through ports. This includes naming logic: the logos lexer + LALRPOP grammar that parse/validate/resolve naming templates generate pure, IO-free, async-free code and live entirely in `domain`. Keeping naming in `domain` makes it testable-first and reusable by later job/execution work.
- **`ArchiveJob` is the aggregate root** (PR4): it holds an ordered `Vec<ArchiveTask>` as the single source of truth. The sequence number and resolved output name are *re-derived from list position* on every read — never stored as a second copy. WHY: the aggregate encapsulates the "ordering ↔ sequence ↔ output name" invariant so the PR5 execution engine can trust it without extra synchronisation. Output names are unique within the job (compared case-insensitively via ASCII case-fold; non-ASCII Unicode folding is deferred). `TaskId` is a stable identity separate from position; it never doubles as a sequence number.
- **IO is isolated behind ports** (`Extractor` rar→dir / `Archiver` dir→zip / `Clock`), implementations in `infrastructure`. PR-5a evolved `Archiver` to `trait Archiver: Send + Sync` with `fn compress(&self, src, dest, ctx: &CompressContext) -> impl Future<Output = Result<(), ArchiveError>> + Send` (RPITIT). WHY: the engine drives implementations across `tokio::spawn`, which needs a `Send` future and a `Send + Sync` trait. `Clock` (`fn now(&self) -> Instant`, `Send + Sync`) was added so `elapsed` is testable with a `FixedClock`. `Extractor` is `Send + Sync` and uses the RPITIT form matching `Archiver`: `fn extract(&self, src_rar: &Path) -> impl Future<Output = Result<Box<dyn ExtractedTree>, ExtractError>> + Send` (no `#[allow(async_fn_in_trait)]`), since the engine drives it across `tokio::spawn` just like the archiver.
- **Default visibility is `pub(crate)`**; layer boundaries are enforced with clippy. Parser/codegen internals — `Token`, `Lexer`, `LexError`, `Segment`, the generated `template` module, and `parse_segments` — are `pub(crate)` or private. The crate's public surface is limited to validated value objects (`NamingRule`, `SequenceNumber`, `FileStem`, `OutputFileName`) and their error enums. WHY: callers cannot bypass `NamingRule::parse` to build unvalidated `Segment`s, and lexer/grammar changes remain non-breaking.
- **IPC error boundary**: domain errors (`NamingRuleError` / `NameError` / `SequenceError`) cross to the frontend as a `String` via `e.to_string()` at the Tauri command layer. The exact message text is a shared contract pinned by tests on both sides (Rust command test and frontend test assert the same string). WHY: the Tauri command is a thin bridge with Rust as the single source of truth — no validation logic is duplicated in TypeScript. The classification error `UnsupportedSourceItem` likewise crosses as the byte-stable string `"unsupported item: <path>"`, contract-pinned by tests (domain `unsupported_source_item_display_matches_ipc_contract` + presentation `classify_path_other_file_is_err`). The only naming-related outward touch points are the `preview_output_name` Tauri command (presentation) and the React `NamingRuleForm`.

### Infrastructure adapter invariants

- **`ZipArchiver` walks the full source file list before creating/opening the destination zip.** If the output zip lands inside the source directory, creating it first lets `WalkDir` encounter the partially-written archive and read it back into itself — a corrupt, order/timing-dependent result (a runtime path-skip via `canonicalize` is fail-open when canonicalization fails under load). Walking first, then writing, makes self-inclusion structurally impossible regardless of platform symlinks or filesystem timing.
- **`ZipArchiver` forces durability before returning.** `tokio::fs::File` writes on the blocking pool and its `Drop` does **not** wait for them, so a naive return can hand back an unflushed/locked archive — an order/timing-dependent CI flake. After `async_zip`'s `close()` writes the central directory, recover the file via `.into_inner()`, then `shutdown().await` + `sync_all().await` so the zip is complete and readable immediately. PR-5a also reports per-entry byte progress through the `CompressContext` and **refuses to overwrite** an existing destination (`OpenOptions::create_new(true)` → `AlreadyExists` → `ArchiveError::Io` → the task fails).
- **`ZipArchiver` cancellation drain symmetry (PR10).** The cancel path previously called a bare `drop(writer)` and then `remove_file`, which could let queued blocking writes race the delete and transiently leave a partial zip. PR10 eliminates this asymmetry: the cancel path now **drains the writer (`close` → recover the file via `.into_inner()` → `shutdown().await` + `sync_all().await`) before calling `remove_file`**, via a shared `drain_to_disk` helper that is also used by the success path. Both paths use the shared helper, but the SUCCESS path propagates drain errors (`?`) while the CANCEL path drains best-effort and proceeds to `remove_file` regardless — so the common cancel path is fully drained, while a rare `close()` IO error on the cancel path leaves the file dropped without an explicit drain (an accepted, platform-dependent limitation, not an absolute guarantee). Mid-extraction unrar cancellation remains out of scope; temp cleanup on cancel is still the `TempWorkspace` RAII `Drop` guarantee.
- **`UnrarExtractor` runs the synchronous `unrar` C API on `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, and owns the `TempWorkspace` guard inside the blocking closure.** Three consequences follow from that choice:
  - The `unrar` crate (bundled UnRAR C++) is synchronous and CPU/IO-bound, so it must not run on the async runtime; `spawn_blocking` keeps the reactor free.
  - `TempWorkspace` is created and held *inside* the closure and only moved out on `Ok`; on any error or a panic in the blocking thread it drops there during unwind, so the temp dir is reclaimed on every exit path (no orphaned temp dirs).
  - The join result is `Result<Result<TempWorkspace, ExtractError>, JoinError>`; the `??` maps a `JoinError` (panicked blocking task) to `ExtractError::Backend("extraction task panicked: …")` and then propagates the inner `ExtractError`, so a panic surfaces as a normal per-task failure rather than escaping. Every fallible `unrar` call (`open_for_processing` / `read_header` / `extract_with_base` / `skip`) is `?`-mapped to `ExtractError::Backend` — no error kind is swallowed.
  - The extraction loop walks the type-state cursor: file headers are extracted under the temp dir base (preserving relative paths) and directory headers are skipped — the UnRAR core recreates parent dirs during file extraction, so skipping directory headers loses no nested files.

## Execution engine (application)

- **`RunArchiveJob` (PR-5a, implemented):** bounded N-way parallelism — `Semaphore(N)` + `tokio::spawn` workers (default `N = available_parallelism`). Workers send immutable messages over an internal mpsc channel to a **single aggregator** that runs on the `execute` task and **owns the `ArchiveJob`** (status) plus the per-task progress projection: single writer / single source of truth → no shared lock. (This supersedes the earlier "shared aggregator" design; the concurrency nucleus is loom-verified in PR-5b.)
- **`ProgressSink` is the only public outbound port.** Workers report cumulative bytes through a `CompressContext` that carries the `TaskId` and a `pub(crate) TaskProgressReport`, so the engine's mpsc channel never leaks onto the public `Archiver` port. The aggregator emits `JobProgress { overall_eta, per_task: Vec<TaskProgressEntry { id, progress, eta }>, elapsed }` — `overall` is a derived method (`fn overall(&self) -> TaskProgress`), not a stored field.
- **Error isolation + completeness:** one task failing never stops the others; failures are tallied into `JobSummary { succeeded, cancelled: Vec<TaskId>, failed: Vec<(TaskId, String)> }`. The reason is the full `ArchiveError::to_string()` (Display), not the raw backend message. `into_summary` reconciles any task left non-terminal (e.g. a panicked worker) into `failed`, so `succeeded + cancelled + failed` always equals the task count. **The summary is state-derived, not message-derived:** it iterates `job.tasks()` and classifies each task's *final* `TaskStatus` (disjoint + total — every task classified exactly once), which is precisely what makes the engine's `let _ = tx.send(…)` drops safe: a lost or out-of-order worker message can never drop a task from the tally. Latent constraint: if the summary were ever recomputed from the message *stream* instead of job state, those ignored sends would become lost-terminal-event bugs.
- **Rar support (PR8, implemented):** `FormatRegistry` resolves each `SourceItem` before compression — `Folder` → compress directly; `RarFile` → `UnrarExtractor::extract` (via `spawn_blocking` over the `unrar` crate) into a `TempWorkspace` RAII guard, then compress the temp dir. The guard's `Drop` guarantees temp cleanup even on error. `run_one` includes a not-started cancellation checkpoint before extraction; mid-extraction interruption is out of scope. The cancellation token is **not** polled inside `spawn_blocking`, so a token fired during extraction is not observed until extraction finishes (whether it completes normally or returns an error); the task then proceeds through the normal compress path, where the per-zip-entry checkpoint can still observe the token. Password-protected, multi-volume, and encrypted rar archives also fail their own task and are out of scope for this release.

**Zip input support (feature/zip_dandd, implemented):** `.zip` files are now accepted as inputs alongside `.rar` and `Folder`. The pipeline is unchanged — any archive input is extract → rename → recompress to a standard Deflate zip; output is always a normalized zip regardless of input format.

- **`ArchiveExtractor` (router) behind the `Extractor` port.** Production DI wires `ArchiveExtractor` (not `UnrarExtractor`) at `commands.rs::run_job_inner`. `ArchiveExtractor { rar: UnrarExtractor, zip: ZipExtractor }` dispatches by file extension (ASCII-case-insensitive): `.rar` → `UnrarExtractor`, `.zip` → `ZipExtractor`, else → `ExtractError::Backend("unsupported archive: …")` as a defensive fallback (`classify` already gates inputs at the IPC boundary, so this path is hit only if a caller bypasses classification). The generic engine `RunArchiveJob<A, E>` and `FormatRegistry<E>` are UNCHANGED — only the injected `E` changed from `UnrarExtractor` to `ArchiveExtractor`. This is the pattern for adding archive formats without touching the application layer.
- **`ZipExtractor`** (`crates/core/src/infrastructure/zip_extractor.rs`) implements the `Extractor` port using the `async_zip` crate (consistent with `ZipArchiver`). The async_zip read API, CRC `read_to_end_checked` rule, and zip-slip guard internals are documented in `.claude/conventions.md`.
- **`SourceItem::ZipFile` domain variant.** The `SourceItem` enum gained a `ZipFile` variant; `classify` maps a non-directory path with a `.zip` extension to `ZipFile`. See `.claude/domain-model.md` for the `SourceItem`/`classify` domain invariants.
- **Presentation layer.** `SourceKind::Zip` was added to the wire enum in `dto.rs`; `draft_item_from_source` maps `SourceItem::ZipFile` to `SourceKind::Zip`. After any such DTO change, regenerate ts-rs bindings and reformat (see development.md).

**Adding a new input format (harness — extension checklist).** Because an enum-variant addition cascades, adding a format (e.g. 7z) requires, in lockstep:

1. `SourceItem::<Fmt>File` variant + `classify` arm in `domain` — produces compile errors at every exhaustive `SourceItem` match (good).
2. A new `<Fmt>Extractor` implementing the `Extractor` port in `infrastructure`, plus a router arm in `ArchiveExtractor`. **NOTE:** the router's extension strings are NOT compiler-checked against `classify` — they can silently diverge. A `TODO` comment in `archive_extractor.rs` marks this. Both places must be updated by hand.
3. `FormatRegistry::prepare` match + `run_archive_job` `needs_extract` (`matches!` is non-exhaustive — easy to miss; no compile error on the added variant).
4. Presentation: `SourceKind::<Fmt>` in `dto.rs` + arm in `draft_item_from_source`.
5. Regenerate ts-rs bindings (`cargo test export_typescript_bindings --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`) and run `pnpm format` (see development.md).
6. Frontend: file-filter hint, kind-badge, and any drag-drop filter updates.

The `SourceItem` variant addition drives compile errors at the exhaustive matches (safe), but `matches!` macro sites and the router extension strings fail silently — treat steps 3 and 2 as the highest-risk omissions.

- **PR-5b (implemented):** cancellation via `CancellationToken` threaded through `CompressContext` — not-started checkpoint (cancel before compress → task ends `Cancelled`, archiver never called) + per-zip-entry checkpoint in `ZipArchiver::compress` (drains the writer via `drain_to_disk`, best-effort-deletes the partial `dest_zip`, returns `ArchiveError::Cancelled`); `JobSummary.cancelled` tallies cancelled tasks. A loom verification suite (`application/loom_nucleus.rs`, gated `#[cfg(loom)]`) drives the real `Aggregator`/`WorkerMsg`/`ArchiveJob` under loom primitives: three concurrent loom-thread workers send terminal/progress messages over a loom mpsc channel into the single-writer aggregator. Under every loom interleaving it verifies that no message is lost and the summary partitions every task into exactly one of succeeded/cancelled/failed — this checks the **concurrency model** (single-writer aggregation), NOT the tokio runtime, and NOT `CancellationToken` propagation (that signal path is covered by the regular tokio cancel-path tests). Note: loom 0.7 models message count, not sender-drop/channel closure, so the production worker→channel-close→drain ordering is covered by the regular tokio tests, not loom.
- **`EtaEstimator` + `EtaTracker` (PR9, implemented):** a pure `EtaEstimator` (sliding `ETA_WINDOW` time-window moving average, `eta = remaining / throughput`) lives in `application` with no IO or async, using only `domain` types and `std`; an `EtaTracker` annotates each snapshot's `overall_eta` and per-task `eta` inside the engine loop. `Aggregator` stays a pure byte projection — ETA math is a separate, composable concern.

## Presentation layer — design-system foundation

The frontend uses a **two-layer design-token system** in `src/App.css`:

- **Primitive layer** — ASICS raw hex values declared in `:root` (e.g. `--asics-ink: #0a1f4f`, `--asics-brand-red: #e60012`). Dark primitives (charcoal palette, navy lift) are invented since ASICS has no official dark spec.
- **Semantic layer** — the shadcn contract variables (`--primary`, `--background`, `--destructive`, …) are wired to the primitives. Tailwind v4 utilities (`bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, etc.) are exposed via `@theme inline { --color-*: var(--*) }`.

**Dark mode** is class-driven: `.dark` on `<html>` overrides only the semantic layer. `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))` replaces Tailwind v4's default media-query dark variant so the theme is user-controlled. `ThemeProvider` (`src/components/theme-provider.tsx`) toggles the class, persists the choice to `localStorage` under the key `simple-archiver-theme`, and follows the OS via a `matchMedia change` listener only while the theme is set to `"system"`. Persisted values are validated through a type guard (`isTheme`) before use — unrecognised strings fall back to the default rather than being cast blindly.

**Color discipline:** navy (`--asics-ink`) is `--primary`; red `#e60012` is reserved for the single `--brand` CTA (`Button variant="brand"`), `--destructive`, and error badges — not a general accent.

**Functional status token tier and category tier (PR10):** Two additional token tiers were added to `src/App.css` on top of the existing primitive/semantic layers:

- A **functional status tier** — `--status-{success,warning,danger}-{foreground,subtle}` — maps outcome states to colour without coupling them to the shadcn semantic names. These are declared primitive→semantic, defined for both light and dark themes, and exposed via `@theme inline`.
- A **category tier** — `--category-{folder,archive}-{foreground,subtle}` — distinguishes source-item types for icon/badge colouring.

The status axis and category axis are kept strictly distinct and are never mixed.

**Single mapping point — `statusVisual()` (`src/lib/status.ts`):** this is the ONE place that wires a **domain/summary outcome → user-facing label → status token**. No other file should derive a label or colour from a `TaskStatus` or `JobSummaryDto` field directly.

**`RunSummary` is a pure projection of `JobSummaryDto`:** counts are array lengths; failure reasons are the verbatim strings passed in the DTO. No client-side recomputation or re-classification.

**Vocabulary unification (PR10):** the task-lifecycle terminal `TaskStatus::Completed` is tallied at the job-summary level as `succeeded` and shown in the UI as **"Succeeded"**; "Success" is no longer used anywhere. Labels are unified to **Succeeded / Failed / Cancelled** across Rust, DTOs, and the frontend.

**shadcn/ui (new-york)** primitives live in `src/components/ui/`. Keep them faithful to upstream templates; the `cn` helper (`clsx` + `tailwind-merge`) is used throughout, so later utility classes win conflicts (e.g. a variant's `rounded-full` overrides the base `rounded-md`). The `@/` path alias resolves to `src/` (tsconfig `paths` + vite `resolve.alias`).

## Presentation layer — wiring the engine to the UI (PR6)

The four modules in `src-tauri/src/presentation/` form the adapter between the application engine and the Tauri frontend.

### Backend-held session state (single source of truth = Rust)

`JobDraft` (in `state.rs`) accumulates the user's pending job configuration inside `AppState`, which is registered with `tauri::Builder::manage`. The five mutation commands (`add_items` / `reorder` / `set_naming_rule` / `set_output_dir` / `clear_items`) each mutate the draft and return a `DraftSnapshot` so the frontend reflects the current state. (`clear_items` removes all queued items while preserving the naming template and output directory.) `run_job` calls `JobDraft::build` (which calls `ArchiveJob::plan`) and hands the planned job to the engine. WHY: Rust is the single source of truth — no job state is duplicated in the TypeScript layer, so the frontend never needs to sync with the backend between commands.

### Single-active-job invariant

`RunState` (in `state.rs`) holds at most one `CancellationToken`. Its public API is intentionally narrow: `try_start` claims the slot and rejects a second concurrent job with the IPC-contract message `"a job is already running"`; `request_cancel` signals the token; `finish` is the sole way to clear the slot. The slot is freed on every exit path (normal completion, error, or drop) because `run_job` calls `finish` in a deferred cleanup path — the invariant is owned by the type, not by the caller.

### Progress event transport

Progress snapshots flow from the application engine to the frontend via Tauri global events on the channel `archive://progress` (constant `PROGRESS_EVENT` in `dto.rs`). The `run_job` command's awaited return value — a `JobSummaryDto` — IS the completion signal; there is no separate "done" event. Missed progress ticks (e.g. a failed `app.emit`) are silently discarded: a dropped tick must never abort a running job.

### DTO boundary preserves layer purity

Wire-contract types (`ProgressEvent`, `ProgressCounts`, `TaskProgressDto`, `DraftSnapshot`, `JobSummaryDto`, etc.) are authored exclusively in `dto.rs` (presentation). `domain` and `application` carry no `serde` or `ts-rs` derives. Application types (`JobProgress` / `JobSummary`) are mapped to DTOs via `From` impls inside presentation. WHY: this is a concrete realization of the `presentation → application → domain` dependency rule — the wire shape can evolve without touching the core model, and the core stays independently testable.

### Testability seam at the IPC boundary

`ProgressEmitter` (in `events.rs`) is a `trait` over `emit_progress`. Production code uses `TauriEmitter` (wrapping `AppHandle`); integration tests use a `RecordingEmitter` double. The engine entry point is extracted into `run_job_inner(emitter: &dyn ProgressEmitter, …)` in `commands.rs`, which can be called in tests without a live Tauri application. The classification RULE (directory → `Folder`, `.rar` extension → `RarFile`) lives in the domain as `SourceItem::classify`; only the filesystem probe (`path.is_dir()`) stays in `commands.rs` (presentation) because it is IO, and the probed `is_dir` is injected into `classify` so the domain stays pure. An unsupported path yields `UnsupportedSourceItem` (an error, not a third variant).

## Frontend — typed client and store-as-mirror (PR7)

The React layer keeps Rust as the single source of truth, so it owns no job logic of its own.

### Single typed Tauri client (`src/lib/archive.ts`)

The whole IPC surface lives in **one** module of thin `invoke` / `listen` wrappers — `addItems` / `reorder` / `setNamingRule` / `setOutputDir` / `clearItems` / `runJob` / `cancelJob` / `previewOutputName` / `subscribeProgress`, plus the `PROGRESS_EVENT = "archive://progress"` constant (mirroring `dto.rs`). New Tauri commands/events are added here, not scattered across components. (An earlier plan proposed separate `commands.ts` / `events.ts`; the implemented reality is the single `archive.ts`.)

### Store is a thin mirror of the backend (`src/store/jobStore.ts`)

A zustand store holds the UI state. Each mutating action calls the corresponding command and **replaces `draft` with the returned `DraftSnapshot`** — there are **no optimistic updates and no client-side recomputation** of output names or sequence numbers. Output names come from the backend `preview_output_name`; the sequence number is just the 1-based item index (`i + 1`). Progress is wired once on mount via `subscribeProgress(applyProgress)` and unlistened on unmount (the async unlisten is guarded against unmount-before-resolve).

### Positional alignment is the row→task contract

`previewNames` and `taskIdByIndex` are parallel arrays index-aligned with `draft.items`, and `progress.perTask` / the summary arrays are in job order — so a row maps to its `TaskId` purely by position. Because `TaskId` is a stable identity assigned at plan time while row position changes under reorder (see [domain-model.md](../.claude/domain-model.md) "TaskId vs SequenceNumber"), the store **clears `summary` / `progress` / `taskIdByIndex` on every draft edit** (addItems/reorder); otherwise a post-run reorder would mislabel the status column. Async preview recomputation uses a module-level generation counter and discards stale results, so a slower batch can never overwrite a newer one.

### Frontend information architecture (PR11)

The full-screen layout is handled by a presentational `AppShell` (`flex h-screen flex-col`) divided into five fixed vertical zones:

- **header** — title + theme toggle; always visible
- **toolbar** — `SetupToolbar`: add-source buttons, naming template, output dir, Run/Cancel; always visible
- **banner** — optional error alert; occupies space only when present
- **main** — the single scroll region (`flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto`); holds `TaskList` or the `EmptyQueue` empty-state. `min-h-0` is load-bearing: without it a flex child refuses to shrink below its content height and the inner scroll silently breaks.
- **footer** — `StatusBar`: overall progress while running, results summary when done; always visible

This zoning maps the domain lifecycle onto screen space: everything above the queue (`header` + `toolbar`) is mutable pre-run setup; the footer is a read-only post-run observation zone; only the queue region scrolls.

**Single drag-drop subscription:** `useFileDrop()` owns the one `getCurrentWebview().onDragDropEvent` subscription, mounted exactly once in `App`. It returns `{ isDragging }` which drives the presentational `DropOverlay`. Drag-and-drop is the single affordance that accepts BOTH files and folders.

### Progress bars and ETA display (PR9)

Each `ProgressEvent` emitted on `archive://progress` now carries two new optional fields: `overallEtaMs` (overall job ETA in milliseconds) and per-task `etaMs` (inside each entry of the `perTask` array). The frontend renders a shadcn `Progress` bar for the overall job (`OverallProgress` component) and a per-row shadcn `Progress` bar plus a `formatEta` string in `TaskList`. All ETA arithmetic — the sliding `ETA_WINDOW` moving-average — is owned entirely by Rust (`EtaEstimator` / `EtaTracker`); the TypeScript layer only formats milliseconds into a human-readable string and has no ETA logic of its own. Rust is the single source of truth for ETA.

### OUTPUT-zone information architecture + smart default directory

The OUTPUT group (`OutputSettings`) reads top-to-bottom as: the **hero full landing path** (biggest, monospace; only rendered once the preview filename resolves, so the destination directory is never shown in isolation), then **aligned Destination/Name rows** that share one label column and one control column. `OutputDirPicker` shows the chosen path or a `(not set)` empty state with a `Required` badge. The **readiness chip** now lives in `RunControls` (rendered immediately left of the Run button, idle-only) — it was moved off `OutputSettings` so the visual readiness cue sits next to the action it gates and shares the same `Readiness` value (`src/lib/readiness.ts`) that drives Run's `aria-disabled` reason; `OutputSettings` is purely the editing surface. The cross-row alignment is a CSS-only contract (see the layout note in conventions.md).

A **smart default output directory** is applied on mount by `App.tsx`: `src/lib/output-dir-default.ts` resolves the persisted last choice from `localStorage` (key `simple-archiver-output-dir`, validated via the `isValidOutputDir` type guard) and falls back to the OS Downloads folder via the Tauri path API (`downloadDir()`); both reads are non-throwing. Persistence is **best-effort** — `jobStore.setOutputDir` commits the backend result first, then persists in a separate try/catch (see conventions.md "best-effort side-effect isolation"). This is presentation/lib-layer TypeScript using the Tauri path API + `localStorage`; the Rust backend and the single-source-of-truth draft are unchanged — the backend still owns job state, the smart default only seeds the picker.
